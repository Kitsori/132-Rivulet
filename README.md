Adds a brand new vanilla-like moon to Lethal Company!

- A hilly/mountainous terrain, scattered with various fauna and other structures! 
- A more early/mid-game focused moon, targeted to be a moon between the free moons but before Rend/Dine/Titan!

This is now my 2nd moon upload and I put a lot more into this moon than I did my first. A lot of the different objects like bridges/boxes/lights/buildings etc. I modeled myself to try to start learning how to model my own objects/structures better, even made my own texture for the boxes as well! Overall feel like I just learned more since creating my first moon. 

As always please feel free to reach out to me on Discord @Kitsori. (with the period) to let me know about any bugs or anything else you may find.. or go to my mod forum on the Lethal Company Modding discord!
